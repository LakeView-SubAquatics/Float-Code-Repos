// Workflow //
As with most GitHub Repositories, I've assigned branches for each member to work off of, each branch is nameed off of each members name.
If and when you want to merge it into the main, please make a pull request, and someone can approve of it.
Worse case scenario, there should be a hard original v1 backup of the files.
